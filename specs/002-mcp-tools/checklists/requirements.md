# Specification Quality Checklist: MCP Tools Integration

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2025-11-13
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Notes

- Specification is complete and ready for planning
- All requirements are testable and measurable
- Success criteria focus on outcomes (tool loading time, backward compatibility, error handling) rather than implementation details
- Edge cases cover connection failures, invalid configurations, and server unavailability
- Scope is clearly defined with out-of-scope items explicitly listed (multiple servers, other transport types, stateful sessions)
- Assumptions document reasonable defaults for MCP server behavior and authentication
